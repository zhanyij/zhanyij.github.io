Welcome to my academic website! My name is Zhanyi Jiao, and I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Actuarial Science in the Mathematics Department at Illinois State University. My research focuses on Actuarial Science and Quantitative Risk Management, including risk measures, risk sharing, and the theory of model uncertainty. I am also engaged in exploring the applications of these concepts in diverse fields such as Insurance, Finance, and emerging areas like FinTech and InsurTech. I am committed to expanding my expertise to Statistics, particularly by exploring the emerging concept of e-value, with a focus on its applications in Quantitative Risk Management.

I am an Associate of the Society of Actuaries (ASA) from the [SOA](https://www.soa.org/) and a [James C. Hickman Scholar](https://www.soa.org/resources/announcements/press-releases/2023/2023-hickman-scholars/), which emphasizes my commitment to professionalism in the actuarial field. Through my research and experience, I aspire to contribute valuable insights and innovative strategies to the actuarial industry. Thank you for visiting my website. Please feel free to explore my work and reach out with any inquiries or collaborations.
