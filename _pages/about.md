Welcome to my personal academic website! I am Zhanyi Jiao, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/), specializing in actuarial science. Under the guidance of Professors [Jun Cai](https://sas.uwaterloo.ca/~jcai/) and [Ruodu Wang](https://sas.uwaterloo.ca/~wang/index.html), I am pursuing my research in risk measures, risk sharing, and the theory of model uncertainty. My research interests revolve around exploring the applications of these concepts in diverse domains such as insurance and finance, as well as the emerging fields of FinTech and InsurTech. 

I hold the Associate of the Society of Actuaries (ASA) designation from the [SOA](https://www.soa.org/), which has enriched my knowledge and skills in the field. Through my research, I aspire to contribute valuable insights and innovative solutions and strategies to the actuarial industry. Thank you for visiting my website, and please feel free to explore my work and reach out with any inquiries or collaborations.
