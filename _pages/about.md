Welcome to my personal academic website! I am Zhanyi Jiao, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/), specializing in Actuarial Science and Quantitative Risk Management. Under the guidance of Professors [Jun Cai](https://sas.uwaterloo.ca/~jcai/) and [Ruodu Wang](https://sas.uwaterloo.ca/~wang/index.html), I am pursuing my research in risk measures, risk sharing, and the theory of model uncertainty. My research interests also involve exploring the applications of these concepts in diverse fields such as Insurance, Finance, and emerging areas like FinTech and InsurTech. I am committed to expanding my expertise to statistics, particularly by exploring the emerging concept of e-value, with a specific focus on its applications in Quantitative Risk Management.

I am the Associate of the Society of Actuaries (ASA) from the [SOA](https://www.soa.org/) and a recognized [James C. Hickman Scholar](https://www.soa.org/resources/announcements/press-releases/2023/2023-hickman-scholars/), which emphasize my commitment to professionalism in the actuarial field. Through my research and experience, I also aspire to contribute valuable insights and innovative solutions and strategies to the actuarial industry. Thank you for visiting my website, and please feel free to explore my work and reach out with any inquiries or collaborations.
